Explanation of Super Tic Tac Toe
Super Tic Tac Toe is an advanced version of traditional Tic Tac Toe, played on a 3×3 grid of smaller Tic Tac Toe boards. The game follows these rules:

1. The first move can be made in any of the 9 mini-boards.
2. The opponent’s move is restricted to the corresponding mini-board based on the previous player's move.
3. To win, a player must win three mini-boards in a row, column, or diagonal, just like regular Tic Tac Toe but at a macro level.
4. Strategic play is crucial, as each move determines where the opponent can play next.
This version adds depth, strategy, and unpredictability to the classic game!
